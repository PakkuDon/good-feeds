# Good Feeds Diagrams
This folder is for architectural diagrams as code and the rendered diagrams.

Some of these diagrams will be rendered using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/). To render these diagrams copy-paste the code from the relevant .mmd file into [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/). Mermaid does have a CLI but I have not managed to get it running on my machine yet.
