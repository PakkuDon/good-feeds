# 3. Use Go on server-side

Date: 2022-02-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As this is a full stack project we need to pick a language and framework for our backend.

This project is also intended to be a [breakable toy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch05.html#breakable_toys) where I can experiment with other technologies or practices.

## Decision

The backend for this project will be written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

## Consequences

This will be my first side project that uses Go.
